# process

# what are the things that need to be done?

- 1-2 new blogs every week.
- updating the info on the ```archives``` page.
- upload the magazine every month to the ```magazine``` tab
- upload photographs shot by the students every now and then.

# layout of the files

- ```_layout``` : defines the skeleton of the web-page (not to be messed around with)
 
- ```_pages``` : contains *.md* files that has all the content inside of it(these are the files you would be editing to post new content)
 
- ```_posts``` : contains all the blog posts (new blog posts that need to be put up will be added here.
 
- ```images``` : all the images that are used in this web page need to be kept inside of this folder (the images of the blog post need to be stored inside the sub-folder *post images* and photographs inside *photography*
 
- rest of them need not be messed around with. they just contain the protocols to run the website.


# uploading new blog posts

## step-1 : source the blog from the student. 
pretty self explainatory, make sure the blog is well edited and has no mistakes.

## step-2 : create a *.markdown* file in the *_posts* folder
inside this file the first few lines should be dedicated to assigning the *title*,*layout*,*date* and *image* (please refer to[this](https://github.com/MGSE-Blogs/mgse-blogs.github.io/blob/main/_posts/2024-08-29-to-a-new-beginning.markdown?plain=1)) for the format. after the above mentioned variables are defined, upload ur content and save the file.

and just like that the blog post must be up and available for the world to see!


# updating archives page

## step-1 : copy the link of the blog post 
after the blog post has been uploaded and is visible in the home screen of the website, copy the link of the post and head over [here](https://github.com/MGSE-Blogs/mgse-blogs.github.io/blob/main/_pages/archive.md). hyperlink the link with an appropriate title and place under the right *year*. please look at the previous post and follow the same pattern to maintain neatness. 


# posting the magazine 

## step-1 : upload the magaine to the public folder of mgse blogs google drive
if you look at the contents of the mgseblogs google drive, you will notice a folder named ```Magazines```. this is a public folder that contains the magazines of each month. upload the magazine to this folder, no permission is needed to be given to view, after upload just copy the link of the magazine and head to the next step. 

## step-2 : hyperlink the link of the magazine
after you have grabbed the link of the magazine from the drive, head over [here](https://github.com/MGSE-Blogs/mgse-blogs.github.io/blob/main/_pages/magazines.md) and add the hyperlink under the right *year* with the appropriate title. please follow the same way the previous magazines have been hyperlinked.  


```
wishing all of you the very best!
